NAME
    Module::LocalLoad - create and use a local lib/ for globally installed
    modules

SYNOPSIS
      my $module = 'Term::ANSIColor';
      load($module) and printf("%s v%s loaded\n", $module $module->VERSION);

DESCRIPTION
    You're debugging your code, and it's still failing even though you're
    doing everything right. You might have misinterpreted the documentation
    for some module you're using, or perhaps it's not doing what it says it
    should.

    Time to take a peek at the inner guts of said module. Change a few
    things, and see if your problem goes away.

    Changing code in a globally installed module is not such a great idea.
    Sometimes it's not even possible.

    This module will help you set up a temporary local lib/ for the modules
    that you are working on right now. See the "EXAMPLES" section.

EXPORTS
  load( $package )
    When load() is called with a valid, globally installed package name
    several things happen. First, we check if the environment variable
    "PERL_HACK_LIB" is defined and points to a directory that'll be our new
    lib/. If it isnt, we croak, announcing that it needs to be set.

    If the directory already contains a copy of the module, we go ahead and
    load it. We don't want our changes to be overwritten everytime we load
    the module.

    Otherwise, we copy the module, if existing in @INC, to "PERL_HACK_LIB",
    modify @INC so that "PERL_HACK_LIB" comes first, and loads it.

EXAMPLES
    You want to muck around in the inner workings of the IO::File module.

      # load.pl
      use Module::LocalLoad;

      my $m = 'Term::ANSIColor';
      (my $f = $m) =~ s{::}{/}g;
      $f .= '.pm';

      load($m) and printf("%s v%s loaded - %s\n", $m, $m->VERSION, $INC{$f.});

    This will produce something like:

      Term::ANSIColor v3.00 loaded - /tmp/Term/ANSIColor.pm

    Next up, go make some changes to /tmp/Term/ANSIColor.pm . Notice the
    version number reported from ->VERSION:

      vim /tmp/Term/ANSIColor.pm
      perl load.pl

      Term::ANSIColor v3.00_042 loaded - /tmp/Term/ANSIColor.pm

ENVIRONMENT
    PERL_HACK_LIB

    Where the temporary lib should be set up.
